Solar connected greenhouse
==========================

Description:
------------

This is a autonome greenhouse with solar panels, a tank of water and a composter. It is also possible to control a garden.

This project is building around a Arduino Atmega 2560 and a ESP8266. The ESP8266 is optional, it allows to send data in a Json format. 

There are a lot of functionalities like spray, heating, orthicole lamp, fan, cat proof, … each is power by 24 Vdc provide by the solar pane. It can work with 48 Vdc or relay to work over voltage.

The system can measure humidity, temperature, moisture, CO2, level of water, … in several places. Each data can be send at a data center.

You can find drawing to build the same garden, greenhouse and lombricompost. I have provided the drawings.

There are also any stl files to make boxes for sensors and actuators. 

And the most important the drawings and PCB to make a main board with a
touch screen, a remote for the garden and a remote for the greenhouse.
